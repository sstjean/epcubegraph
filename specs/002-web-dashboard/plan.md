# Implementation Plan: Web Dashboard for Energy Telemetry

**Branch**: `002-web-dashboard` | **Date**: 2026-03-22 | **Spec**: [spec.md](spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/002-web-dashboard/spec.md`

## Summary

Build a web dashboard (Preact SPA) for viewing EP Cube energy telemetry data in a browser. The dashboard:

1. **Current readings** (US1, #33): Displays live solar, battery, home load, and grid metrics for 2 EP Cube devices in a side-by-side grid, auto-polling every 5 seconds (FR-012), with stale/offline indicators when data exceeds 3 minutes old. Includes animated energy flow diagram (FR-017) with toggle to gauge dial view.
2. **Historical graphs** (US2, #34): Interactive line charts via uPlot with time range presets (today, 7d, 30d, 1y, custom) and tiered data resolution (1-min for daily, hourly for 2–6 day ranges, daily for weekly/monthly, calendar month for yearly). Data gaps rendered as broken lines. Aggregation notice when downsampled. Grid energy summary bar graph showing Import, Export, and Net kWh totals (#72).

The SPA is hosted on Azure Static Web Apps (Free tier), authenticates via MSAL.js + Entra ID (PKCE), consumes the Feature 001 REST API exclusively (FR-011), and reports client-side errors to Azure Application Insights (FR-020).

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: TypeScript 5.8 / Preact 10.x (SPA); C# / .NET 10 (API — already exists from Feature 001)
**Build Runtime**: Node.js 22 (CI and local development)
**Primary Dependencies**: Preact, preact-router, @azure/msal-browser (MSAL.js), uPlot (charting), @microsoft/applicationinsights-web (telemetry), Vite (build)
**Storage**: N/A — stateless SPA; all data fetched from Feature 001 API at runtime
**Testing**: Vitest 3.x, @testing-library/preact, happy-dom, @vitest/coverage-v8 (100% coverage)
**Target Platform**: Azure Static Web Apps (Free tier); browsers: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge (current + previous major)
**Project Type**: Web application (SPA)
**Performance Goals**: Current readings displayed within 2s (SC-001); graphs for 30d render within 2s (SC-002)
**Constraints**: Single user, 100% test coverage (constitution), TLS-only, authenticated access
**Scale/Scope**: 1 user, 2 EP Cube devices, ~20 metrics at 1-minute intervals

```

**Structure Decision**: The dashboard is a standalone SPA under `dashboard/` — separate from the API (`api/`) since they have different runtimes, build tools, and deployment targets (SWA vs Container Apps). Infrastructure additions in `infra/` extend the existing Terraform configuration. This mirrors Feature 001's structure pattern. Application Insights gets its own `.tf` file to keep resource types cleanly separated.

## Design Decisions

### Per-Device Historical Charts (FR-021)

Historical graphs render one stacked uPlot instance per EP Cube device rather than merging all device data into a single chart. Each chart is labeled with the device name (derived from alias grouping, same as DeviceCard). Series colors are shared across all charts for visual consistency (FR-023). This matches the current-readings pattern of per-device cards and avoids confusing overlapping data from different devices.

### Device Alias Grouping

EP Cube devices expose two separate targets per physical unit: one for the battery (`storage_battery` class) and one for the solar inverter (`home_solar` class). The dashboard groups these into a single DeviceCard per physical EP Cube unit by extracting the base alias (e.g., "Steve St Jean 3") from the `Device.alias` field, stripping trailing "Battery" or "Solar" suffixes. This presents a unified view per EP Cube rather than showing two disconnected device entries.

### Gauge Dial Presentation

Current readings use SVG arc gauges (`GaugeDial` component) instead of plain text values. Each metric gets a dedicated gauge with appropriate scaling:
- **Solar**: 0–12 kW (unidirectional)
- **Battery SOC**: 0–100% (unidirectional)
- **Battery Power**: ±20 kW (bidirectional — charging vs discharging)
- **Home Load**: 0–10 kW (unidirectional)
- **Grid**: ±20 kW (bidirectional — import vs export)

Bidirectional gauges render from a center zero point. This visual approach gives at-a-glance comprehension of system state without reading numeric values.

### Secondary Value Display

The Battery SOC gauge displays remaining stored energy (kWh) as a secondary value below the percentage. The `GaugeDial` component accepts an optional `secondaryValue` prop rendered at a smaller font size beneath the main reading.

### Energy Flow Diagram (FR-017)

The default current-readings view is an animated SVG energy flow diagram per device. Flow lines animate directionally (CSS dashed-line animation) between Solar, Grid, EP Cube Gateway, Battery, and Home nodes. Lines activate when power exceeds a 10W threshold and dim when inactive. Battery node shows SOC ring, stored kWh, and charge/discharge state. A radiogroup toggle switches between Flow and Gauges views.

### Grid Energy Summary Bar Graph (FR-025, #72)

The History page displays a grid energy summary above the per-device time-series charts. This bar graph shows 3 horizontal bars:
- **Grid Import**: total kWh pulled from the grid (sum of positive `grid_power_watts` samples × step/3600)
- **Solar Export**: total kWh pushed to the grid (sum of |negative `grid_power_watts`| samples × step/3600)
- **Net**: Export − Import (positive = net producer, negative = net consumer)

Values are summed across all devices (both EP Cubes). Unlike the per-device historical charts (FR-021), this is a single combined view because the net grid position is a whole-system metric. The bar graph always fetches grid data at hourly resolution (step=3600s) regardless of the chart's display step, to preserve the bidirectional import/export split that coarser buckets would collapse. The Net bar is conditionally colored: green when positive (net producer = good), red when negative (net consumer). When the API returns empty series (no data for the period), the component shows "No Grid Data" instead of bars. When data exists but sums to zero, zero-value bars are shown. The computation is implemented as a pure utility function (`computeGridEnergy`) for testability, with the `GridEnergySummary` component handling data fetching and rendering. CSS horizontal bars are used (no additional charting library) since only 3 static bars are needed.

### Application Insights Integration (FR-020)

Application Insights is initialized lazily — only when the `VITE_APPINSIGHTS_CONNECTION_STRING` env var is set. This means:
- **Production/Staging**: Telemetry is captured (env var injected at build time from Terraform output)
- **Local dev**: No telemetry unless explicitly configured (no noise in dev workspace)
- **Tests**: Module is mock-friendly (telemetry.ts exports simple functions wrapping the SDK)

Tracked events: unhandled exceptions (via `trackException`), failed API calls (4xx/5xx), page load performance (`trackPageView`). No PII is captured.
